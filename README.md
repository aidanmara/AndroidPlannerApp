#Hi thanks for checking out my mobile app!


##My Goal


in this project was to get more familiar with both Kotlin and with the concept of CRUD applications and softwares. I wanted to make a customizable CRUD system that allowed users to create plans and set reminders for themselves in a simple yet effective and robust manner.


##What I Learned


Throughout this project, I increased my understanding of and my skills in the Kotlin language and Android Studio and how different components, pages, and libraries work together.


I learned about managing data and systems in the app to avoid issues with excess memory and processing power.


By working on this CRUD object I improved my understanding of the creation and handling of data in a secure and robust way.



##How to Install


Android Studio installation is preferred, however you should be able to run the application by downloading it to an android device or emulator.
